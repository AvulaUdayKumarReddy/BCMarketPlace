This project is a decentralized app, where any user can list the items and any user can buy the items by connecting to the wallet, here we are using the metamask as the wallet. The App is built using the solidity smart contract on Remix IDE and the front end is built using HTML,CSS and Javascript.( as well as web3.js).
